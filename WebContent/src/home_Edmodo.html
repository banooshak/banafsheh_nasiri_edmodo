								tube loosely coiled in the abdomen (spread out, it would be more
								than 20 feet long). The small intestine continues the process of
								breaking down food by using enzymes released by the pancreas and
								bile from the liver. Bile is a compound that aids in the
								digestion of fat and eliminates waste products from the blood.
								Peristalsis (contractions) is also at work in this organ, moving
								food through and mixing it up with digestive secretions. The
								duodenum is largely responsible for continuing the process of
								breaking down food, with the jejunum and ileum being mainly
								responsible for the absorption of nutrients into the
								bloodstream.</div>
